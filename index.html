  CURATE MY DATE

<h3>
New York City is a big place, with so much to see and too much to do
</h3>

<div class="intro">
<p>
We'll help you plan your night (or day) for any occasion! Even if you're...
</p>

<div class="scenario">
  <i class="fa fa-heart"></i>
  <p>going on a first date in Astoria, but you just moved to the Upper East Side and don't even know the difference between <strong>36th Ave</strong> and <strong>36th Street</strong>. Not to mention the address they sent you has a dash in it.</p>
</div>

<div class="scenario">
  <i class="fa fa-glass"></i>
  <p>seeing a movie with that other couple you've gone on double dates with, but you also find them kind of boring, and they randomly suggest you guys get drinks afterwards and your partner agrees. <strong>Please, at least a place with good music?</strong></p>
</div>

<div class="scenario">
  <i class="fa fa-magic"></i>
  <p>seeing your adult nephew, who's visiting from out of town and loves magic shows. <strong>Yes, magic shows.</strong> Now you're looking for a magic show (and dinner nearby) that isn't just for four year olds.</p>
